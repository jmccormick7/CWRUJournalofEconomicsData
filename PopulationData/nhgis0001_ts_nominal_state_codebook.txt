Geographic Integration Methods
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Nominal Integration:

    Nominally integrated tables link geographic units across time according to
    their names and codes, disregarding any changes in unit boundaries. The
    identified geographic units match those from each census source, so the
    spatial definitions and total number of units may vary from one time to
    another (e.g., a city may annex land, a tract may be split in two, a new
    county may be created, etc.). The tables include data for a particular
    geographic unit only at times when the unit's name or code was in use,
    resulting in truncated time series for some areas.
    
    Users should be cautious when interpreting changes in nominally integrated
    time series because a single unit code may refer to distinctly different
    areas at different times. If you are uncertain whether any boundaries
    changed in your areas of interest, we recommend inspecting NHGIS GIS files
    to confirm. (NHGIS supplies GIS boundary files for all units and years in
    nominally integrated time series *except* 1970 places and county
    subdivisions.)
    
    Alternatively, for some topics and time periods, NHGIS provides
    "geographically standardized" time series, which provide data from multiple
    times for a single census's geographic units (e.g., 2000 and 2010 data for
    2010 census units). A disadvantage of standardized time series is that, in
    areas where source units do not nest perfectly within a unit of the standard
    year (e.g., where a source 2000 unit intersects multiple 2010 units), NHGIS
    applies interpolation to standardize the data, a process which may
    occasionally produce substantial errors.
